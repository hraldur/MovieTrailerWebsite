#Movie Trailer Website
The Movie Trailer Website is my first project in Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. The project focuses on writing server side code to store a list of movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. The data will then be expressed on the web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers.
